This directory contains the source code for the Xeros operating system
which is a desicated version of the Xinu OS[1].

To compile Xeros, 

1. Go into the compile directory
2. make

To create a boot image,

1. Go into the boot directory
2. make

Good luck!


[1] D. Comer et al.  "The Xinu Approach"


To run Xeros under bochs run the following command from this directory once 
everything is compiled.

bochs "floppya: 1_44=boot/zImage"

Once bochs is running, choose option 6 to start the simulation to
execute Xeros.

(Acutally, given the way the bochsrc file is setup all you need to do
is run bochs and type 6 from this directory. The file is configured so
that the default image to boot from is set to 
"floppya: 1_44=boot/zImage"
